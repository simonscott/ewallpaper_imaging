MPI based functional simulator enables fast prototyping and debugging for eWallpaper applications.

eWallpaper applications are written in SPMD (single-program multiple-data) style. One instance of the program is launched for each of the 128x128 processors. 

Within a single node, each processor is simulated in its own thread, with blocking sends and receives implemented via mutexes. 

Across MPI node boundaries, virtual channels are implemented via MPI_Isend and MPI_Irecv functions.

The number of virtual processors per MPI node is adjustable and transparent to the simulated application. 

For fast prototyping, all 128x128 processors may be simulated on a single node. 

For computationally intensive applications, virtual processors can be distributed across many MPI nodes.
