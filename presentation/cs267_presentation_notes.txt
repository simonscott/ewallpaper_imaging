The eWallpaper is a wallpaper with thousands of low-power processors embedded inside. 

Each processor has a single radio transceiver and antenna.

We developed a radar algorithm that allows us to image the room using the radio transceivers.

Each radio transmits a millimeter wave pulse, and records the reflected echoes from the objects in the room.

The echoes are combined using our algorithm to form a 3d image.

The algorithm is borrowed from the field of Synthetic Aperture Radar.

However, there are a number of challenges against implementing SAR on the eWallpaper.

- The echo data is distributed amongst 16000 processors rather than being on a single processor.
  
- The restrictive mesh topology makes moving data between the nodes difficult.

- And there is only a small amount of local memory per node, on the order of kilobytes. 

Thus no single node can store all the data.

We developed a distributed version of the SAR algorithm that overcomes these challenges. 

To test the algorithm, we simulate the antenna response reflecting off an artificial scene, such as the sphere shown on the left.

These responses were fed into our algorithm, which we ran on Hopper, and the resulting recovered image is shown below.

The graphs on the right show the projected performance on the actual eWallpaper hardware. 

For 128x128 antennas, our distributed algorithm runs 600 times faster than a naive serial implementation.

At our proposed link bandwidth of 1 Gbps, the algorithm achieves a framerate of 75 frames per seconds, enabling low latency recognition of human gestures.
